## Testing Philosophy

Testing machine learning models is fundamentally different from testing traditional software:

1. **Non-deterministic outputs**: ML models may produce slightly different results even with the same inputs
2. **Performance vs correctness**: We test for acceptable performance rather than 100% correctness
3. **Robustness testing**: We need to test how models handle edge cases and adversarial inputs
4. **Concept drift**: Models can degrade over time as real-world data changes
5. **Data quality impacts**: Testing must account for data biases and quality issues

This project implements a comprehensive testing approach that addresses these unique challenges.

## Current Test Suite

Our test suite consists of several types of tests:

### 1. Unit Tests (`test_model_loading.py`)

Tests for properly loading models and tokenizers:

- Tests that the model loading function works correctly
- Verifies model architecture and configuration
- Ensures tokenizers are properly initialized

### 2. Functional Tests (`test_sentiment_model.py`)

Tests for model behavior and predictions:

- Verifies the model predicts expected sentiments on obvious examples
- Tests model confidence scoring
- Tests handling of edge cases (empty strings, very long text)
- Tests batch processing capabilities

### 3. Performance Tests (`test_sentiment_model.py`)

Tests for model performance metrics:

- Verifies accuracy meets minimum thresholds
- Tests inference speed requirements
- Measures memory usage during inference
